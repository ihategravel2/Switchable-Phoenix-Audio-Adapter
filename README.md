# Switchable-Phoenix-Audio-Adapter

Features a switch for input/out and a more rebust, better fitting design. This is a very meh way of making it bi-directional but it's better then making it two seperate versions for some reason. 
This uses my overall much better design for how it fits in the screw terminal connecter then the other adapter everyone else uses.
