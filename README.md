# Switchable-Phoenix-Audio-Adapter

Features a switch for input/out and a more rebust, better fitting design. This is a very meh way of making it bi-directional but it's better then making it two seperate versions for some reason. 
This uses my overall much better design for how it fits in the screw terminal connecter then the other adapter everyone else uses.

## Meh-ness
To keep this cheap it only uses two layers so the routing kinda has to suck and I don't like using vias. Ignore the DRC warnings about the legs I've had this design made before with no issues. This doesn't use a Ground Plane like the other adapters made by others don't have em.

## Functionality
When 'IN' in the negative L/R legs are tied to GND.
When 'OUT' negative L/R legs are floating. 

This is part of the extron spec.
